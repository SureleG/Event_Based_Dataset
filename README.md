# Event_Based_Dataset

A diverse array of datasets, encompassing indoor hallways, tree-lined paths, doorways, and other scenarios, have been recorded for the purpose of comprehensively evaluating the accuracy of event cameras. Furthermore, the accuracy of the event camera has been extensively evaluated across various illumination conditions, with thethree distinct illumination scenarios: normal lighting, HDR, and dimly-lit/dark environments. In addition, two categories of movement  were involved during the event camera experimentation: low dynamic motion and high dynamic motion. A robot vehicle was employed to evaluate the performance of the event camera in low dynamic conditions. The robot operates smoothly, moves at a low speed, and makes gradual turns, making it a suitable choice. In contrast, pedestrians with erratic, unpredictable, and abrupt motions were selected as the platform of high dynamic motion.
